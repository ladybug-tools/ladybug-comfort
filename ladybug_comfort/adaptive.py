    when the following criteria are met:

    (a) There is no mechanical cooling or heating system in operation
        (in the case of ASHRAE-55, no mechanical cooling system is installed
        and no heating system is in operation)

    of conditioned buildings and a neutral temperature function was obtained for
    heated and cooled modes of operation.  While the coefficient of determination (aka.
    R squared) of this function was not as strong as that for free-running buildings,
    it appears to be stronger than PMV calculated from the observed conditions in the
    SCATs data set[2].  Accordingly, it has been published in CIBSE guide[3] and has
    been included here along with methods to calculate netural temperature functions
    in between free-running and heated/cooled conditions.
