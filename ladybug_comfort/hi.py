    """Calculate heat index (HI) from air temperature and relative humidity.

    Heat index is derived from original work carried out by Robert G. Steadman [1],
    which defined heat index through large tables of empirical data.
    The formula here approximates the heat index to within +/- 0.7C and is
    the result of a multivariate fit [2].
    Heat index was adopted by the US's National Weather Service (NWS) in 1979.
