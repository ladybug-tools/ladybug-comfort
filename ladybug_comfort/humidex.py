    """Calculate Humidex from air temperature and the Dew Point.

    The Humidex is a Canadian innovation first used in 1965.
    It combines the temperature and humidity into one number to reflect the
    perceived temperature.
    Because it takes into account the two most important
    factors that affect summer comfort, it can be a better
    measure of how stifling the air feels than either temperature or
    humidity alone. [1]

    Air temperatures below 20c will give a generally meaningless result as the Humidex
    only describes perceived heat.

    The Humidex is a "nominally dimensionless quantity" but is generally
    recognized by the public as equivalent to the degree Celsius [2]
