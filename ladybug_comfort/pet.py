"""Utility functions for calculating Physiologic Equivalent Temperature (PET).

PET uses the Munich Energy Balance Model (MEMI), which is arguably the most
detailed 3-node human energy balance model in common use today. It can account
for various physiological features of the human subject, including age, sex,
height, and body mass, making it one of the only models that is suitable for
forecasting the thermal experience of a specific individual. This also makes
it one of the better models for estimating core body temperature and whether
a given set of conditions is likely to induce hypothermia or hyperthermia in
a specific individual.

PET is, itself, a "feels like" temperature and is defined as the operative
temperature of a reference environment that would cause the same physiological
response in the human subject as the environment under study. That is, the
same skin temperature and core body temperature.

    This method is based on Peter Hoeppe's original PET Fortran code, from the
    VDI Norm 3787, Blatt 2 [1][2], as well as Djordje Spasic's Ladybug Legacy
    source code. It includes the corrected reference environment and updated
    vapor transfer model published by Edouard Walther (AREP, France) and
    Quentin Goestchel (ENS Paris-Saclay, France) [3].

    Chris Mackey added support for the specification of metabolic rates in met
    (instead of Watts above basal metabolism) using a USDA report that relates
    Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) (assumed to be 1 met) to Basal Metabolic
    Rate (BMR) using a Physical Activity Level (PAL) ratio [4].

            to Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) and this is 1.17 times the male

            of the average worldwide life expectancy).
        sex: A value between 0 and 1 to indicate the sex of the human subject,
            which influences the computation of basal metabolism. 0 indicates male.
            1 indicates female and any number in between denotes a weighted average
            between the two. (Default: 0.5).
        ht: The height of the human subject in meters. (Default: 1.65m for
            a worldwide average between male and female height).
        m_body: The body mass of the human subject in kilograms. (Default: 62 kg
            for the worldwide average adult human body mass).

            the following: "standing", "seated", "crouching". (Default: "standing").
